**************** SplashScreen *******************
Splash screen is containing AnimatedBuilder, which requires animation and builder,
    - to builder we pass a method
    (BuildContext context, Widget? child){
        retrun Transfrom.rotate(
            angle: angle,
            child:    // we pass the widget that we want to rotate.
        );
    }

    - AnimatedBuilder requires animation, for this we have to create controller for it. (also we added TickerProviderStateMixin with State<SplashScreen> class)
